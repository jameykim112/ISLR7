No natural way to convert a qualitative response variable with more than two levels into a quantitative response that is ready for linear regression. If binary qualitative response then can use dummy variable to code response, otherwise classification method should be used

Logistic regression models the probability that Y belongs to a par- ticular category. Logistic function used in logistic regression which always produces S-Shaped curve prediction between 0 - 1 (P146 for equation)

Maximum likelihood method used in logistic regression model. Try to find βˆ0 and βˆ1 such that plugging these estimates into the model for p(X), given in (4.2), yields a number close to one for all individuals who defaulted, and a number close to zero for all individuals who did not.

Multiple linear regression
- Maximum likelihood method used to estimate regressors
- Confounding: Variable that influences both independent and dependent variable

Linear discrimant analysis
- Linear discriminant analysis popular when > 2 response Classes
- In this alternative approach, we model the distribution of the predictors X separately in each of the response classes (i.e. given Y ), and then use Bayes’ theorem to flip these around into estimates for Pr(Y = k|X = x).
